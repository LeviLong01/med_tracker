Application Summary:

Hosted in Heroku: https://medtrackerlsl.herokuapp.com/

    This application will allow for users to sign up and enter in medications they
    prescribed. In a future world, this application could aggrigate all medications
    prescribed to a patient from various EMRs, but for now we take baby steps.
    
    
Features to Implement:

    Top priority additions to add
        User Sign-Up/Sign-On
            Users have the ability to signup. However not impersonaiting other users
            would be a good thing so need to fix that next
        Layout
            Design is mostly there, will go back to give a more custom feel for the application
